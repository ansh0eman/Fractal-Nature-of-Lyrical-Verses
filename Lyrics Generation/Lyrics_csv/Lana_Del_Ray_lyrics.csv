Lana Del Ray,Young and Beautiful,"I've seen the world, done it all
Had my cake now
Diamonds, brilliant, and Bel Air now


Hot summer nights, mid-July
When you and I were forever wild
The crazy days, city lights
The way you'd play with me like a child


Will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothing but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?


I've seen the world, lit it up as my stage now
Channeling angels in the new age now


Hot summer days, rock and roll
The way you'd play for me at your show
And all the ways I got to know
Your pretty face and electric soul

Dear Lord, when I get to Heaven
Please, let me bring my man
When he comes, tell me that You'll let him in
Father, tell me if You can
All that grace, all that body
All that face makes me wanna party
He's my sun, he makes me shine like diamonds


And will you still love me when I'm no longer young and beautiful?
Will you still love me when I got nothin' but my aching soul?
I know you will, I know you will, I know that you will
Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?


Will you still love me when I'm no longer beautiful?
Will you still love me when I'm not young and beautiful?"
Lana Del Ray,Summertime Sadness,"Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you the best


I got my red dress on tonight
Dancin' in the dark, in the pale moonlight
Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style
High heels off, I'm feelin' alive


Oh my God, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey, I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore (One, two, three, four)


Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That, baby, you the best


I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness

Lana Del Ray,West Coast,"Down on the West coast, they got a sayin'
""If you're not drinkin', then you're not playin'""
But you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?
Down on the West coast, I get this feeling like
It all could happen, that's why I'm leaving
You for the moment, you for the moment
Boy Blue, yeah, you


You're falling hard, I push away, I'm feelin' hot to the touch
You say you miss me and I wanna say I miss you so much
But something keeps me really quiet, I'm alive, I'm a lush
Your love, your love, my love


I can see my baby swinging
His Parliament's on fire and his hands are up
On the balcony and I'm singing
Ooh, baby, ooh, baby, I'm in love
I can see my sweet boy swaying
He's crazy y cubano como yo, la-la
On the balcony and I'm saying
Move, baby, move, baby, I'm in love
I'm in love (I'm in love)

Down on the West coast, they love their movies
Their golden gods and rock 'n' roll groupies
And you've got the music
You've got the music in you, don't you?


You push it hard, I pull away, I'm feeling hotter than fire
I guess that no one ever really made me feel that much higher

Lana Del Ray,A&W,"I haven't done a cartwheel since I was nine
I haven't seen my mother in a long, long time
I mean, look at me
Look at the length of my hair and my face, the shape of my body
Do you really think I give a damn
What I do after years of just hearing them talking?


I say I live in Rosemead, really, I'm at the Ramada
It doesn't really matter, doesn't really, really matter


Call him up, ""Come into my bedroom""
Ended up, we fuck on the hotel floor
It's not about havin' someone to love me anymorе
This is the experiеnce of bein' an American whore


Called up one drunk, called up another
Forensic Files wasn't on
Watching Teenage Diary of a Girl
Wondering what went wrong
I'm a princess, I'm divisive
Ask me why, why, why I'm like this
Maybe I'm just kinda like this

If I told you that I was raped
Do you really think that anybody would think
I didn't ask for it? I didn't ask for it
I won't testify, I already fucked up my story
On top of this (Mm), so many other things you can't believe
Did you know a singer can still be
Looking like a sidepiece at thirty-three?
Got a cop who turned on the backbeat
Puts the shower on while he calls me
Slips out the back door to talk to me
I'm invisible, look how you hold me
I'm invisible, I'm invisible
I'm a ghost now, look how you hold me now

I tell you all the time, Heaven is a place on Earth with you
Tell me all the things you wanna do

It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
And baby, now you do


Mmm


Singin' in the old bars, swinging with the old stars
Livin' for the fame
Kissin' in the blue dark, playing pool and wild darts
Video games
He holds me in his big arms, drunk, and I am seeing stars
This is all I think of
Watchin' all our friends fall in and out of Old Paul's, this is my idea of fun
Playin' video games

Signals crossing can get confusin'


It's enough just to make you feel crazy, crazy, crazy
Sometimes, it's enough just to make you feel crazy


You get ready, you get all dressed up
To go nowhere in particular
Back to work or the coffee shop
Doesn't matter 'cause it's enough
To be young and in lo-ove

Look at you, kids, you know you're the coolest
The world is yours and you can't refuse it

You fucked me so good that I almost said ""I love you""

Your poetry's bad and you blame the news
But I can’t change that, and I can't change your mood, ah

It's just what you do
Your head in your hands
As you color me blue
Yeah, you're just a man
All through and through

You act like a kid even though you stand six foot two

Why wait for the best when I could have you? You?

Lana Del Ray,Ride Monologue,"I was in the winter of my life
And the men I met along the road were my only summer
At night I fell asleep with visions of myself dancing and laughing and crying with them
Three years down the line of being on an endless world tour and my memories of them were the only things that sustained me
And my only real happy times
I was a singer
Not a very popular one
I once had dreams of becoming a beautiful poet
But upon an unfortunate series of events saw those dreams dashed and divided like a million stars in the night sky
That I wished on over and over again, sparkling and broken
But I didn’t really mind because I knew that it takes getting everything you ever wanted and then losing it to know what true freedom is
When the people I used to know found out what I had been doing how I had been living, they asked me why, but there’s no use in talking to people who have a home
They have no idea what its like to seek safety in other people
For home to be wherever you lie your head
I was always an unusual girl
My mother told me that I had a chameleon soul
No moral compass pointing due north
No fixed personality
Just an inner indecisiveness that was as wide and as wavering as the ocean
And if I said I didn’t plan for it to turn out this way I’d be lying

Because I was born to be the other woman
Who belonged to no one
Who belonged to everyone
Who had nothing
Who wanted everything
With a fire for every experience and an obsession for freedom that terrified me to the point that I couldn’t even talk about it
And pushed me to a nomadic point of madness that both dazzled and dizzied me
See Lana Del Rey LiveGet tickets as low as $160


Every night I used to pray that I’d find my people
And finally I did
On the open road
We had nothing to lose, nothing to gain, nothing we desired anymore
Except to make our lives into a work of art
Live fast
Die young
Be wild
And have fun
I believe in the country America used to be
I believe in the person I want to become
I believe in the freedom of the open road
And my motto is the same as ever
""I believe in the kindness of strangers""
And when I'm at war with myself
I ride
I just ride
Who are you?
Are you in touch with all of your darkest fantasies?
Have you created a life for yourself where you can experience them?
I have
I am fucking crazy
But I am free"
Lana Del Ray,Cherry,"Love (Yeah), I said real love is like feelin' no fear

""Come on, baby, you can thrive""

Told you I wanted more, that's not what I had in mind
I just want it like before, we were dancin' all night
Then they took you away, stole you out of my life
You just need to remember


I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember (Oh, baby)
Say you'll remember (Oh, baby)
Ooh, I will love you 'til the end of time"
Lana Del Ray,Fuck it I love you,"I like to see everything in neon
Drink  lime green, stay up 'til dawn
Maybe  the way that I'm living is killing me
I like to light up the stage with a song
Do shit to keep me turned on
But  one day I woke up like
""Maybe  I'll do it differently""


So I moved to California‚ but it's just a state of mind
It  turns out everywhere you go‚ you take yourself‚ that's not a lie
Wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
It's killing me slowly


Dream a little dream of me
Make  me into something sweet
Turn the radio on, dancing to a pop song
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it‚ I love you
Fuck it, I love you
I really do


I used to shoot up my veins in neon
And shit's even brighter; you're gone
So many things I would say to you
I want you

Thinking, ""I wish I could extrapolate some small intention
Or maybe just get your attention for a minute or two""


Will I die? Or will I get to that ten-year mark?
Where I beat the extinction of telomeres?
And if I do, will you be there with me, Father, Sister, Brother?


Charlie, stop smoking
Caroline, will you be with me?
Will the baby be alright?
Will I have one of mine?
Can I handle it even if I do?
It's said that my mind
Is not fit, or so they said, to carry a child
I guess I'll be fine


It wasn't my idea, the cocktail of things that twists neurons inside
But without them, I'd die
They say there's irony in the music, it's a tragedy, I
See nothing Greek in it
Give me a mausoleum in Rhode Island with Dad, Grandma, Grandpa, and Dave
Who hung himself real high
In the National Park sky, it's a shame and I'm crying right now
To get to you, save you, if I take my life
Find your astral body, put it into my arms
Give you two seconds to cry
Take you home, I, I'll give you a blanket

When I was fifteen, naked, next-door neighbors did a drive-by
Pulled me up by my waist, long hair to the beach side
I wanted to go out like you, swim with the fishes
That he caught on Rhode Island beaches
But, sometimes, it's just not your time

Caroline, what kind of mother was she to say I'd end up in institutions?
All I wanted to do was kiss Aaron Greene and sit by
The lake, twisting lime into the drinks that they made
Have a babe at sixteen in the town I was born in, and die


Aaron ended up dead and not me
What the fuck's wrong in your head to send me away, never to come back?
Exotic places and people don't take the place of being your child
I give myself two seconds to cry

Let it crash over me
Like the waves in the sea
Call me Aphrodite, as they bow down to me


Sunbather, moon chaser, queen of empathy
I give myself two seconds to breathe
And go back to being a serene queen
I just needed two seconds to be me"

He had flashes of the good life, he was like
""Should I jump off this building now or do it on the double?""


'Cause, baby, if your love is in trouble
Baby, if your love is in trouble

It kinda makes me laugh
Runnin' down that path
When you're good as gold
'Cause when you know, you know


Word to all my friends
With their rеd flags, their white knights
Their black еyes and their blue lies
If you're askin' yourself, ""How do you know?""
Then that's your answer, the answer is ""No""
You gotta run, gotta run, run, run, run like your head's on fire
Run away like your head is on fire

Screwed up, scared, doing anything that I needed
Shining like a fiery beacon


You got that medicine I need
Fame, liquor, love, give it to me slowly
Put your hands on my waist, do it softly
Me and God, we don't get along, so now I sing


No one's gonna take my soul away

Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees, sprees and I'm singing

Can I let go, and let your memory dance

I was there for the third 'cause I couldn't be
There for the one who was closest to me
But I can't say I run when things get hard

So everyone was there, they were standin', laughin'
And I'm on the side with my tears streamin' down

He thought mine was his to cough into his mouth
We've only got hours
And I just can't stop cryin' 'cause all of the ways

That's how the light gets in
That's how the light gets in""


Think by the third of March, I was cracked open
Finally, the ground was cold, they wouldn't open
Brought by the sunlight of the spirit to pour into me
There's a name for it in Japanese, it's ""Kintsugi""
They sang folk songs from the '40s
Even the fourteen-year-old knew ""Froggie Came A-Courtin'""
How do my blood relatives know all of these songs?
I don't know anyone left who knows songs that I sing


That's how the light gets in
That's how the light gets in

But, Daddy, I miss them
I'm at the Roadrunner Café
Probably runnin' away from the feelings today
In the snow-capped mountains of the desert
Daddy, I miss them
I'm in the mountains
Probably runnin' away, I've been meaning to say
That there's nothing to do except know that this is


How the light gets in
By cracking, the light gets in
It's how the light gets in
That's how the light gets in
That's how the light gets in
Then you're golden, ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah
Just another folk song, but anyway
I try so hard, but that's okay
It's how the light gets in
It's how the light gets in
It's how the light gets in"
Lana Del Ray,The Blackest Day,"Carry me home, got my blue nail polish on
It's my favorite color and my favorite tone of song
""I don't really wanna break up, we got it going on""
It's what you gathered from my talk, but you were wrong


It's not easy for me to talk about
I have heavy heartstrings
I'm not simple, it's trigonometry
It's hard to express
I can't explain


Ever since my baby went away
It's been the blackest day
It's been the blackest day
All I hear is Billie Holiday
It's all that I play
It's all that I play


Because I'm going deeper and deeper (Deeper)
Harder and harder (Harder)
Getting darker and darker

Like the future and those things
'Cause there's nothing for me to think about

Than to have, to let her
Get you under her spell of the weather
I got you where I want you
You're deader than ever
And falling for forever
I'm playing head games with you
Got you where I want you
I got you, I got you
I got you where I want you now


Ever since my baby went away
It's been the blackest day
It's been the blackest day

Sneakin' out, lookin' for a taste of real life
Drinkin' in the small town firelight

Sweet sixteen and we had arrived
Walkin' down the streets as they whistle, ""Hi, hi""
Stealin' police cars with the senior guys
Teachers said we'd never make it out alive


There she was, my new best friend
High heels in her hand, swayin' in the wind
Oh, she starts to cry, mascara runnin' down her little Bambi eyes
""Lana, how I hate those guys""


This is what makes us girls
We all look for heaven and we put love first
Somethin' that we'd die for, it's a curse

Cheerin' our names in the pink spotlight
Drinkin' Cherry Schnapps in the velvet night


Yo, we used to go break into the hotel

Runnin' from the cops in our black bikini tops

A freshmen generation of degenerate beauty queens

Don’t let it stop


He has a white corvette like I want it
A fire in his eyes, know, I saw it
He’s bleeding from his brain and his wallet
He’s sick and he’s taken but honest
The liquor on your lips, the liquor on your lips
The liquor on his lips I just can’t resist
As close as I’ll get to the darkness
He tells me to, “Shut up, I got this”

You taste like the fourth of July
Malt liquor on your breath, my, my…


You can be the boss, daddy
You can be the boss
Taste like a keg party, back on the sauce
I like you a lot, I like you a lot
Don’t let it stop

Bad to the bone, sick as a dog
You know that I like, like you a lot

I need you, I need you babe
Like I never needed anyone
You’re wrong but you’re so much fun
You say you treat 'em mean
To keep 'em keen
But you, you're not that nice
But you taste like the fourth of July

Lana Del Ray,Sweet,"Stars in my eyes, hiking up Griffith
Thinking about who was sad and what didn't
Get said in the Midwest, wish I could tell you now
I wrote you a note, but I didn't send it
'Cause that's the best method the women here taught me about
What you don't really understand
I've got magic in my hand, stars in my eyes


I'm a different kind of woman
If you want some basic bitch, go to the Beverly Center and find her
I'm sweet, bare feet
If you wanna go where nobody goes
That's where you'll find me
In the sweet north country
If I'm not there, comе to my house on Genesee


What you doin' with your lifе? Do you think about it?
Do you contemplate where we came from?
Lately, we've been makin' out a lot
Not talkin' 'bout the stuff that's at the very heart of things
Do you want children? Do you wanna marry me?
Do you wanna run marathons in Long Beach by the sea?
I've got things to do, like nothing at all
I wanna do them with you
Do you wanna do them with me?

Baby, you'll never grow old in my eyes
With your golden grill, true love never dies
You wanna watch me while I watch TV
While you're t-t-t-t-touching me
We're forever young in paradise
As long as you got the Chevrolet, I will ride


We're gonna party like it's 1949
We're in that Chevrolet from July to July
Gonna see it all before he says goodbye
Every man deserves to see the sunrise


""Every man gets his wish""
""Every man gets his wish""

You said I'd never make it out outta here alive

I was working down in the corner cafe
You drove by in a Chevrolet
Whistle at me as my hips go sway
""Lana Del Rey, how you get that way?""

He loves the heart shape my ass is

Of me on a John Deere
Jenny handed me a beer
Said, ""How the hell did you get there?""
Oh, Oklahoma
Mm-mm, mm


There were flowers that were dry
Sittin' on the dresser
She asked me where they're from
I said, ""A place I don't remember""
Oh, Oklahoma (Oh-oh)


Jenny jumped into the pool
She was swimmin' with Nikki Lane
She said, ""Most men don't want a woman
With a legacy, it's our bane""
She said ""You can't be a muse and be happy too
You can't blacken the pages with Russian poetry
And be happy""
And that scared me
'Cause I met a man who

Just to help me if I'd paint my banisters blue

Said he'd fix my weathervane
Give me children, take away my pain
And paint my banisters blue

There's a hole that's in my heart
All my women try and heal
They're doin' a good job
Convincin' me that it's not real
It's heat lightning, oh-oh-oh, oh


'Cause there's a man that's in my past
There's a man that's still right here
He's real enough to touch
And in my darkest nights, he's shinin'
Ooh-ooh-ooh


Jenny was smokin' by the pool
We were writin' with Nikki Lane
I said I'm scared of the Santa Clarita Fires
I wish that it would rain
I said the power of us three can bring absolutely anything
Except that one thing
The diamonds, the rust, and the rain
The thing that washes away the pain
But that's okay, 'cause

Now when weather turns to May
All my sisters come to paint my banisters green
My blue banisters gray
Tex and Mex are in the Bay
Chucky's makin' birthday cake
Chickens runnin' bare feet, there's a baby on the way
And now my blue banisters are green and gray, ah-ah

Hangin' out the Hilton Hotel window
Screamin', ""Hey, you, baby, let's go""
My chest, the Sierra Madre
My hips, every high and byway
That you trace with your fingertips like a Toyota
Run your hands over me like a Land Rover


In Arcadia, Arcadia
All roads that lead to you as integral to me as arteries
That pump the blood that flows straight to the heart of me
America, America
I can't sleep at home tonight, send me a Hilton Hotel
Or a cross on the hill, I'm a lost little girl
Findin' my way to you, Arcadia


My body is a map of LA
And my heart is like paper, I hate you
I'm not from the land of the palms, so I know I can't stay here

Lana Del Ray,LA Who Am I to Love You?,"I left my city for San Francisco
Took a free ride off a billionaire's jet
LA, I'm from nowhere, who am I to love you?
LA, I've got nothing, who am I to love you when I'm feeling this way and I've got nothing to offer?
LA, not quite the city that never sleeps
Not quite the city that wakes, but the city that dreams, for sure
If by dreams, you mean in nightmares

LA, I'm a dreamer, but I'm from nowhere, who am I to dream?
LA, I'm upset, I have complaints, listen to me
They say I came from money and I didn't
And I didn't even have love, and it's unfair
LA, I sold my life rights for a big check and I'm upset
And now I can't sleep at night and I don't know why
Plus, I love Zach, so why did I do that when I know it won't last?

LA, I picked San Francisco because the man who doesn't love me lives there
LA, I'm pathetic, but so are you, can I come home now?
Daughter to no one, table for one
Party of thousands of people I don't know at Delilah where my ex-husband works
I'm sick of this, but can I come home now?
Mother to no one, private jet for one
Back home to the Tudor house that borned a thousand murder plots
Hancock Park, it's treated me very badly, I'm resentful
The witch on the corner, the neighbor nobody wanted
The reason for Garcetti's extra security
See Lana Del Rey LiveGet tickets as low as $160LA, I know I'm bad, but I have nowhere else to go, can I come home now?
I never had a mother, will you let me make the sun my own for now, and the ocean my son?
I'm quite good at tending to things despite my upbringing, can I raise your mountains?
I promise to keep them greener, make them my daughters
Teach them about fire, warn them about water
I'm lonely, LA, can I come home now?

I left my city for San Francisco
And I'm writing from the Golden Gate Bridge
But it's not going as I planned
I took a free ride off a billionaire and brought my typewriter
And promised myself that I would stay, but
It's just not going the way that I thought
It's not that I feel different, and I don't mind that it's not hot
It's just that I belong to no one, which means there's only one place for me
The city not quite awake, the city not quite asleep
The city that's still deciding how good it can be

And also
I can't sleep without you
No one's ever really held me like you
Not quite tightly, but certainly, I feel your body next to me
Smoking next to me
Vaping lightly next to me
And I love that you love the neon lights like me
Orange in the distance
We both love that
And I love that we have that in common
Also, neither one of us can go back to New York
For you are unmoving
As for me, it won't be my city again until I'm dead
Fuck the New York Post
LA, who am I to need you when I've needed so much, asked for so much?
And what I've been given, I'm not sure yet
I may never know that either until I'm dead
For now, though, what I do know
Is although I don't deserve you
Not you at your best and your splendor
With towering eucalyptus trees that sway in my dominion
Not you at your worst
Totally on fire, unlivable, unbreathable, I need you
You see, I have no mother
And you do
A continental shelf
A larger piece of land from where you came
And I?
I'm an orphan
A little seashell that rests upon your native shores
One of many, for sure
But because of that, I surely must love you closely to the most of anyone

For that reason, let me love you
Don't mind my desperation
Let me hold you, not just for vacation
But for real and for forever
Make it real life
Let me be a real wife to you
Girlfriend, lover, mother, friend
I adore you
Don't be put off by my quick-wordedness
I'm generally quite quiet
Quite a meditator, actually
I'll do very well down by Paramhansa Yogananda's realization center, I'm sure
I promise you'll barely even notice me
Unless you want to notice me
Unless you prefer a rambunctious child
In which case, I can turn it on too
I'm quite good on the stage as you may know
You might have heard of me
So either way, I'll fit in just fine
So just love me by doing nothing
And perhaps, by not shaking the county line
I'm yours if you'll have me
But regardless, you're mine"

'Cause what about all these children
And what about all their parents?
And what about all their crowns they wear
In hair so long like mine?
And what about all their wishes
Wrapped up like garland roses
Around their little heads?
I said a prayer for a third time


I'd trade it all for a stairway to Heaven (A stairway, stairway to Heaven)

You make me feel I'm invincible
Just like I wanted
No more candle in the wind
It's not like I'm invisible
Not like before when I was burning at both ends


We did it for fun, we did it for free
I did it for you, you did it for me
We did it for the right reasons

If you get lonely, think of me only
Prison isn't going to keep me from you
Remember Coney Island and how we
Went into the water, 'til the waves turned blue?
Nobody does have to know that our love's alive
Keep it on the low if you want to hide
Got that same address if you want to write
One Greenwich Avenue, wishing and thinking of you


Living without you's like TV in black and white
You turned me on and brought color into my life
When I'm around you, suddenly, I realize
That I was blind before I saw the world through your eyes


If you get lonely, think of this only
Heaven hasn't forgotten about you
Though you can't hold me, pick up and phone me
Use your one phone call on your ex-girl, boo
I won't tell a single soul how you spend your nights
In that single cell, holding your pillow tight
If you really are afraid, then you ought to know
That you're the one I want, the one I want forever more

Lana Del Ray,Judah Smith Interlude,"Don't you understand what that means?
It means quit lusting after your neighbor
That's a heck of a life
You get to love your children in front of you
You get to love
You ever talk to somebody
""I want a new life""
""I don't love my wife anymore""
""I don't love my kids anymore""
""I'm missing out on life""
They're usually my age
Does that sound like love?
It's a life dominated with lust
And for too long, they've been holding it off
And finally, they just get weak and they say
""It doesn't matter anymore""
And the Spirit of God says
""I'll infuse you with dеsires for what you have
And what's in front of you"" (Yeah, yеah, yeah)
(Desires for what you have)
So, as He works deep in your heart
As you call out to Him and say
""I'm here, do it in me, Man""
""Help me want what I got""
""Help me love what's in front of me""
""Help me want more of my wife and more of my friends""
""And help me serve the city I live in and not wish it away and hope I can move""
""Help me, God""
""I wanna be a man of love, not a man of lust""
But you've gotta do that
So I bring you to this verse and I'm done, I'm done
Psalms, chapter eight
And you know where I got this verse?
This is gonna sound crazy to you, but I'm gonna tell you the absolute truth
It's gonna make me sound so spiritual, so I'm looking forward to it
I woke up this morning and God said, ""Check the Bible app""
I don't know if it was God, but it felt like God
And I had the thought in my head, “Check the Bible app”
I'm gonna speak to you from the verse of the day
That means I don't have to do anything
I don't have to look anywhere, I just get the verse of the day
So I get to the verse of the day
And here's the verse of the day, today, in the Bible app
Look at this (That's cool)
""Look at the splendor of the skies
Your creative genius glowing in the heavens
When I gaze, when I gaze at Your moon and Your stars
Mounted like jewels in their settings
I know You are the fascinating artist who fashioned it all""
When I look up and I see such wonder and workmanship above
""I have to ask this question""
""I've gotta ask this question""
Compared to all this cosmic glory
""Why would you ever bother with puny, mortal man?"" or be
Ooh, don't get me started on it
I could preach for another hour on infatuated
Or be infatuated with Adam's son
""Why are you so infatuated with me?""
You're the star creator, You're the ocean maker (Yeah, yeah)
You're the whale creator, you're the rhino designer
Who, who are you? (Rhino designer)
And then it goes on in verse five
And it says
""Yet, what honor You have given to me
Created only a little lower than Elohim""
Which is the name of Creator God, Artist God
You wanna call God ""Artist""?
At some point tonight, before you go to bed, go, ""Yo, Elohim""
And He'll hear, ""You're the best Artist ever""
""The little Elohim, crowned like kings and queens with glory and magnificence
You have delighted, You have delegated to them
Mastery over all You have made""
You have made me a partner with You
I used to think my preaching was mostly about You
And you're not gonna like this, but I'm gonna tell you the truth

Looking at this gangster guy
Thinking he's a hot shot
Pouring me a big shot
Trying to get me drunk and high


He wishes to be seen with me
In his limousine
And he says we'll have a real good time
Well X-X-O but I want you to know


Every single night
In the lights
I'll be sparkling bright
I'm just a party girl
Trying to get my drinks for free from you
If you hold me tight

On the streets of LA
Where the future is now
We dance like nobody is watching us
And we live like we want to
But it can also get a little crazy
Unless there's something to hold on to
For me, that was true love


I was a young girl, selfish and wild
Like a fire in L.A
Hot like the summer and mean like a child
Who keeps crying 'til she gets her way
(Like a true star)


There were roses in my hair
Rock and roll on blare and I was in trouble
No one could rock me like you could
I was a bad girl gone good


Look at me now, I have everything
You gave to me and my heart can sing
I was a kid who could only drink
Dance on tables, making deals with devils
Like a drunk beauty queen
Fighting the fantasy, hooked on the scene
And it brought me to my knees
And it's all because of you
(You know what I'm talkin' about)

Call me before I get stupid
Make me uncrazy like you did


Look at me now, I have everything
You gave to me and my heart can sing
I was a kid who could only drink
Dance on tables, making deals with devils
Like a drunk beauty queen
Fighting the fantasy, hooked on the scene
But you brought me to my knees
And it's all because of you


It isn't hard to see you've got a hold on me
Give me your money, love me to death
Talk like a baby cause I'm so elated
He tell me that I ain't seen nothing quite yet
I don't wanna lose it
I'm in love but I didn't choose it

Roses in my hair, dancing in the air
Feels like I'm flying
Tell me you love me, boy, do it
It's just like I thought, I just knew it


Look at me now, I have everything
You gave to me and my heart can sing
I was a kid who could only drink
Dance on tables, making deals with devils

About seasons of old

Lana Del Ray,She’s Not Me,"39 ContributorsShe’s Not Me Lyrics
Down, down, down
Mm, uh-huh
Huh, let's go!


When you got her in the back seat
Drivin' round the back streets
Trying to block me out
(Do you remember my name?)
Cruising down Santa Monica Boulevard
Does it light up the spark?
(Do you remember my name?)


Is she your Ride-or-Die bitch?
Does she know I'm tattooed onto your heart?
You can try to fight it
I have left my mark on you
There is nothing you can do


When you think you're over me
And your bad baby's dead and gone
(Remember) I'm the ghost in your machine
I'm your real life suicide-blonde
(You like that?)
You're in love, you're in love, you're in love
Well she might be here, might be hot
But baby she's not me

She's not


When you take her to Chateau Marmont
'Cause you booked the top suite
Lay her on the bed
(Do you remember my name?)
Strip her down to her bare ass
In her Kiki de Montparnasse
Like I used to have
(Do you remember my name?)


Is she your Ride-or-Die bitch?
Does she make you shiver under your skin
Just the way that I did?
It won't be the same again
She don't compare to who I am


When you think you're over me
And your bad baby's dead and gone
(Remember) I'm the ghost in your machine
I'm your real life suicide-blonde
(You think that)
You're in love, you're in love, you're in love
Well she might be here, might be hot
But baby she's not me

You try to forget and you tell her that you miss her
But I bet every time you go to kiss her
You get a hot rush feeling on your lips
It's me taking over you, throwing you a curveball
Reminding you of our true romance and
Just like the first time you learned to dance and
I showed you all those moves she can't do
She's not me (me, me)


When you think you're over me
And your bad baby's dead and gone
(Remember) I'm the ghost in your machine
I'm your real life suicide-blonde

You're in love, you're in love, you're in love

Lana Del Ray,Prom Song (Gone Wrong),"44 ContributorsProm Song (Gone Wrong) Lyrics
Boy, it's late, walk me home, put your hand in mine
At the gate, stop and say, ""be my valentine""
You are, by far, the brightest star
I've ever seen, and I never dreamed
I'd be so happy that I could die


You used to say that I was beautiful like Cleopatra
But you the king, too, so I would say, ""back at ya""
I flip my hair and make you stare and put my makeup on
And make up stories 'bout my life and put on very cherry balm
And even then, I knew that we were something serious
That you would dominate my thoughts like radio to Sirius
I'd see you in the hall like, ""hello, hello""
Up against the wall like, ""let's go, let's go""


Let me take you out of this town
Let me do it right now, baby
Dancing 'til dawn, staying forever young
Let's get out of this place
'Cause you're starting to waste within this teenage wasteland
You will never see my face
If you don't get me out of this place now, baby, I'm not crazy
I'm leaving, are you coming with me?

Watching television, kissing 'til we see the sun
So far, we are safe in the dark
And I never dreamed that I'd be the queen
And I'd be so happy that I could die


You used to call yourself The Don and call me Queen Diana
You always make me blush and say, ""shut up boy, you bananas!""
You pull my hair and push me down and chase me, make me run
You played me Biggie Smalls, and then my first Nirvana song
So even then, when no one's friends were really serious
I knew you loved me by the way you looked in second period
I'd see you in the hall like, ""hello, hello""
Up against the wall like, ""let's go, let's go""


Let me take you out of this town
Let me do it right now, baby
Dancing 'til dawn, staying forever young

'Cause you're starting to waste within this teenage wasteland
You will never see my face
If you don't get me out of this place now, baby, I'm not crazy
I'm leaving, are you coming with me?

I know that they say that all I want
Is to have fun
And get away for rainy days
I know that they think I've come undone
But I'm in love, I wanna run, run, run away
I'm leaving, are you coming with me?


Let me take you out of this town
Let me do it right now, baby

I sing the Body electric;
The armies of those I love engirt me, and I engirt them;
They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them, (Man you've got to be crazy!)
And discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of the Soul


Womanhood, and all that is woman - and the man that comes from woman
The womb, the tits, nipples, breast-milk, tears, laughter, weeping, love-looks, love-perturbations and rising
The voice, articulation
Language
Whispering, shouting aloud
Food, drink, pulse, digestion, sweat, sleep
Walking, swimming, poise on the hips
Leaping, reclining, embracing, arm-curving and tightening
The continual changes of the flex of the mouth
And around the eyes
The skin, the sun-burnt shade, freckles, hair
The curious sympathy one feels, when feeling with the hand the naked meat of the body
The circling rivers, the breath, and breathing it in and out
The beauty of the waist, and thence of the hips, and thence downward toward the knees
The thin red jellies within you or within me - the bones and the marrow in the bones
The exquisite realization of health;
Oh I say, these are not the parts and poems of the Body only, but of the Soul
Oh I say now, these are the Soul!


(Oh I must have you, or no one)


- ""You know it's not always gonna be this way, right?""

In honor of Jack's birthday tonight, I thought bring somebody here tonight that Jack can jack off to. (Laughs)
No, with seriousness, are you ready? Ladies...

(All the money, feel my temperature rising)


I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked
Dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix
Angel-headed hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night
Who poverty and tatters and hollow-eyed and high sat up smoking in the supernatural darkness of cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities contemplating jazz
Who bared their brains to Heaven under the El and saw Mohammedan angels staggering on tenement roofs illuminated
Who passed through universities with radiant cool eyes hallucinating Arkansas and Blake-light tragedy among the scholars of war
Who were expelled from the academies for crazy & publishing obscene odes on the windows of the skull
Who cowered in unshaven rooms in underwear, burning their money in wastebaskets and listening to the Terror through the wall
Who got busted in their pubic beards returning through Laredo with a belt of marijuana for New York
Who ate fire in paint hotels or drank turpentine in Paradise Alley, death, or purgatoried their torsos night after night
With dreams, with drugs, with waking nightmares


And so, from being created in his likeness, to being banished for wanting to be too much like him, we were cast out, and the garden of Eden transformed in to the garden of Evil
Los Angeles, The city of Angels, A land of Gods and Monsters, The in-between realm where only the choices made from your free will, will decide your souls final fate
Some poets called it the entrance to the Underworld, but on some summer nights, it could feel like Paradise, Paradise Lost


Dear John forgive us our sins, dear John forgive us our sins
Master of the Universe, creator of all forgive us our sins
Dear John forgive us our sins, dear John


You ask me why I love her? Well give me time, I'll explain
Have you ever seen a Kansas sunset or an Arizona rain?
Have you ever drifted on a bayou down Louisiana way?
Or watched a cold fog come drifting in over San Francisco Bay?
Have you heard a bobwhite calling in the Carolina pines
Or heard the bellow of a diesel at the Appalachia mines?
Does the call of Niagara thrill you when you hear her waters roar?
Or do you look with awe and wonder, Massachusetts shore
Brave new men who stepped on Plymounth's rock?
And do you think of them when you stroll along a New York City dock?
Have you seen a snowflake drifting in the Rockies, way up high?
Or seen the sun come blazing down from a bright Nevada sky?
Do you hail to the Columbia as she rushes to the sea
Or bow your head at Gettysburg at our struggle to be free?
You ask me why I love her? I've got a million reasons why:
It's my beautiful America, beneath God's wide, wide sky"

he was the only one for me.
We both knew it, right away.
And as the years went on, things got more difficult --
we were faced with more challenges.
I begged him to stay. Try to remember what
we had at the beginning. He was charismatic, magnetic,
electric and everybody knew it. When he walked in
every woman's head turned, everyone stood up
to talk to him. He was like this hybrid, this mix of
a man who couldn't contain himself.
I always got the sense that he became torn
between being a good person and
missing out on all of the opportunities that life could
offer a man as magnificent as him.
And in that way I understood him
and I loved him.
I loved him, I loved him, I loved him.
And I still love him.

I came in hot
Made decisions beforehand
My mind made up
Things that would make me happy
To do them or not
Each option weighed carefully
A plan for each thought
And then I walked through the door past the open concept
And saw Violet bent backwards over the grass
Seven years old with dandelions grasped tightly in her hand
Arched like a bridge in a fallen handstand
Grinning wildly like a madman
With the exuberance that only doing nothing can bring
Waiting for the fireworks to begin

Money is the anthem of success
So before we go out, what's your address?


I'm the national anthem
God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons, Bugatti Veyron
He loves to romance 'em
Reckless abandon
Holding me for ransom, upper echelon
He says to be cool, but I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair
Hand on the back of my neck
I said, ""Can we party later on"", he said ""Yes, yes, yes...""
(Of course we can, my darling)


And I want it all
I want the rings and bling and the sweet skyline
Yeah, I want it all (from you)
I wanna sing, wanna swing on the stage and shine
Yeah, I want it all
I want my dreams, want the things that love can't buy

See what you've done to me, King of Chevron
He says to be cool, but I'm already coolest

It's a love story for the new age
For the sixth page
We're on a quick, sick rampage
Wining and dining, drinking and driving
Excessive buying, overdose and dying
On our drugs, and our love, and our dreams, and our rage
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well
I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his belltower hotel


Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara and your party dress


I'm the national anthem
Boy, put your hands up
Give me a standing ovation
Boy, you have landed
Babe, in the land of sweetness and danger
Queen of Saigon
He says to be cool and I know he means it
He's loving my look
And I'm loving all his strategic ways

Waitin' for the walkin' green

And he played real good
On his clarinet for free


Now me, I play for fortunes
And those velvet curtain calls
I've got a black Limousine and two gentlemen
Who escort me through these halls
And I'll play if you've got the money
Or if you're a friend to me
But the one-man band by thе quick lunch stand
He's been playin' real good for free


Nobody stopped to hеar him
Though he played so sweet and high
They knew he had never been on the TV
So they passed his music by

Maybe put on a harmony

Lana Del Ray,Question for the culture,"Question for the culture:

Now that Doja Cat, Ariana, Camila, Cardi B, Kehlani and Nicki Minaj and Beyoncé have had number ones with songs about being sexy, wearing no clothes, fucking, cheating etc - can I please go back to singing about being embodied, feeling beautiful by being in love even if the relationship is not perfect, or dancing for money - or whatever I want - without being crucified or saying I'm glamorizing abuse??????
I'm fed up with female writers and alt singers saying that I glamorize abuse when in reality I'm just a glamorous person singing about the realities of what we are all now seeing are very prevalent emotionally abusive relationships all around the world.
With all of the topics women are finally allowed to explore I just want to say over the last ten years I think it’s pathetic that my minor lyrical exploration detailing my sometimes submissive or passive roles in my relationships has often made people say I’ve set women back hundreds of years.
Let this be clear, I’m not not a feminist -but there has to be a place in feminism for women who look and act like me - the kind of woman who says no but men hear yes - the kind of women who are slated mercilessly for being authentic, delicate selves, the kind of women who get their own stories and voices taken away from them by stronger women or by men who hate women.

I’ve been honest and optimistic about the challenging relationships I’ve had.
News flash!	That’s just how it is for many women.
And that was sadly my experience up until the point that those records were made. So I just want to say it’s been a long 10 years of bullshit reviews up until recently and I’ve learned a lot from them.
but I also feel it really paved the way for other women to stop ‘ putting on a happy face’ and just be able to say whatever the hell they wanted to in their music-
unlike my experience where if I even expressed a not of sadness in my first two records I was deemed literally hysterical as though it was literally the 1920s
Anyways none of this has anything to do about much but I’ll be dealing some of my feelings in my next two books of poetry (mostly the second one) with Simon and Schuster. Yes I’m still making personal reparations with the proceeds of the books to my choice of Native American foundations which I’me very happy about. And I’m sure there will be tinges of what I’ve been pondering in my new album that comes out September 5th.

Lana Del Ray,My Bedroom is a Sacred Place Now – There Are Children at the Foot of My Bed,"Last year, when I wrote you my last letter
the beginning of my future poetry
I acknowledged who you really were for the first time

I didn’t call you by any other name
I let you know that I knew the true nature of your heart
That it was evil, and that it convinced me that darkness was real
that the devil is a real devil
and that monsters don’t always know that they’re monsters

But projection is an amazing thing
after you left and burnt the house down
you tried to convince me that it was I who was holding the matches
You told me that I didn’t know who I was, but I do
I love rose gardens
I plant violets every time someone leaves me
I love the great sequoias of Yosemite
And if you asked my sister to describe the first thing she thinks of when she thinks of me
she would say ""camp fire smoke""

I’m gentle
I’m funny when I’m drunk
But I haven’t been drunk for 14 years
I go on trips with my friends to the beach who don’t know that I’m crazy
I can do that
I can do anything
Even leave you
See Lana Del Rey LiveGet tickets as low as $160Because my bedroom is a sacred place now that there are children at the end of my bed
telling me stories about the friends that they pretend to hate, that they will make up with later
And there are fresh cut flowers that I grew myself in vases from the yard on nightstands, hand carved by old pals from Big Sur

And the longer I stay here
the more I am sure
But the more I step into becoming a poet
The less I will fall into being with you
The more I step into my poetry
The less I will fall into being with you
The more I step into my poetry

Lana Del Ray,Salamander,"Get out of my blood, salamander!
I can’t seem to blow off enough steam to get you out of my head
Soul cycle you to death, run you out of my blood to San Pedro
And yet, everywhere I go, it seems there you are,
And there I am

I don’t want to sell my stories anymore, stop pushing me
Some stories aren’t meant to be sold
Some words aren’t meant to be told

I want to leave them underneath the nightstand to be forgotten
or remembered should my thoughts come upon them in the middle of the night after a long beach day
Or by you, some afternoon, to thumb through with your worn warm after-work hands
I love you, but you don’t understand me, I’m a real poet!
My life is my poetry, my love making is my legacy!
My thoughts are about nothing, and beautiful, and for free

You see, the things that can’t be bought can’t be evaluated, and that makes them beyond human reach
Untouchable, safe, otherworldy
Unable to be deciphered or metabolized

Something metaphysical,
like a view of the sea on a summer day on the most perfect winding road taken in from the car window

A thing perfect, and ready to become a part of the texture of the fabric of something more ethereal

Lana Del Ray,Never to Heaven,"May my eyes always stay level to the horizon
may they never gaze as high as heaven, to ask why
May I never go where angels fear to tread
so as to have to ask for answers in the sky
The whys in this lifetime i've found are inconsequential
compared to the magic of the nowness - the solution to most
questions
there are no reasons

And if there are - i'm wrong
but at least i won't have spent my life waiting
looking for God in the clouds of the dawn

I'll be up early to rise though of course -
but only to make you a pot of coffee

That's what i was thinking this morning Joe
that it's times like this as the marine layer lifts
off the sea from the view of our favorite restaurant
that i pray that i may
always keep my eyes level to your eyeline
never downcast at the table cloth
You see, Joe
it's times like this that the marine layer lifts
off the sea on the dock with out candle lit
that i think to myself
there are things you still don't know about me
like sometimes i'm afraid my sadness is too big
and that one day you might have to help me handle it
See Lana Del Rey LiveGet tickets as low as $160But until then
may my eyes always stay level to the skyline
assessing Long Beach's glittering new development
never higher than the tallest building
never to heaven or revenant
'Cause i have faith in man as strange as that seems
in times like these
and it's not just because of the warmth i've found in your
brown eyes
It's because i believe in the goodness in me
that it's firm enough to plant a flag in
or a
rosebud
or to build a new life."

Through the year I've called you in and out of my orbit
You, in your madness
the satellite that constellates my world
mimicking the inner chaos that I've disowned
a mirror to my past life retributions
and a reflection of my sadness
If I'm going to keep on living the way that I'm living
I can't do it without you
My feet aren't on the ground
I need your body to stand on
your name to define me
on top of being a woman
I am scared
and
ethereal
And


There are seven worlds in my eyes


I'm accessing of all them once


One to draw my words from and my muses
Another one I try and harness late at night that lies somewhere
off of the right of Jupiter
And then of course there's this one I live in
The land of a thousand fires
That's where you come in

You
Vernon
Dylan
Two blue steel trains running through the tunnels of your cool blue steel eyes


To guide me far from the world of my early days
That I can't quite make out clearly
That beckon me towards high sea cliffs
On long car rides


Towards a future place
A world unknown to me
Made up of something surreal and dripping
Flowers in solar systems oversized


You Vernon Dylan


No words needed to sponge up the dark nights
No explanations for the globes in my eyes
Shoulder to shoulder in the factory light
Letting me be who I would have been if everything had turned out alright

Three alternative endings
Now course through my blood on ice
But I thrive because I say I do
And because it's what I write


But honestly, if you weren't here with me
I don't know what things would look like


That's my why no matter what world I'm in
I'm accessible by only one satellite

You know, sometimes I think God is playing a little game with me
Looking down from Heaven, laughing
And trying to see how much I can take
Because the way things go, it's like a joke
Nobody's had more shots at the moon and missed than me


It's like I got my life stuck, stuck on rewind
Trying to make something of myself
Life's got something else in mind
I'm fighting a losing game and I'm biding my time
You won't be my man, do I understand? No, stop
I don't want to hear another word about your why nots
I bought your bullshit all before
Now you trying to sell me more, babe


Man who makes a beast out of himself got nothing to lose
Sold my soul long ago, nothing left to choose
I'm tired, tired of singing the blues
I'm tired


I'm walking down the streets
You wouldn't know what I was thinking
It's just another white girl day, hey
Ribbons in my hair and I am sinking down
A double life, a sordid past and I am drinking now
I want to be bad, you say you were glad to see me, shut up

With loneliness as my occupation
I know that he's right but I don't care tonight

Knocking you down, I'm fucked

Be the soul the world is living

Not for giving
Just for taking

Down the street that’s green and winding
Past the bushes cypress thriving
Past the chain link fence and driving
Further down the road less travelled
There you are athleisure wear unraveled
Now I see you clear


Standing stoic blue and denim
Eyes not blue but clear like heaven

You don’t want to be forgotten


You just want to disappear"

And I am but not how you think
I live in a Tudor house
Under the freeway in Mar Vista by the beach
When you call I take my phone to the picnic table
That I bought from the Rose Bowl
And I listen to the rushing cars above
And I think about the last time you visited me
The last time we made love
How the noise got louder and louder during rush hour
Until it sounded like the sea
And it felt like the ocean was the sky
And that I was flying because you were two feet taller than me
Until you took me in your arms
And I could touch the stars
And they all fell down around my head
And I became an angel
And you put me to bed

People think that I'm rich and I am but not how they think
I have a truck with a gold key chain in the ignition
And on the back it says: happy,  joyous, and free

And when I drive
I think about the last time my friends were driving with me
How the radio was so loud that I couldn't hear the words
So we became the music

You joke that I'm rich and I am but not how you think
I live in a Tudor house under the freeway
Off of Rose Avenue, 12 blocks from the beach
And when you call I put your sweater on
And put you on speaker
And chat for hours underneath the trees
And think about the last time you were here lying next to me
How the noise from the cars got louder and louder
During rush hour
Until it sounded like a river or a stream
And it felt like we were swimming
But it wasn't just a dream
We were just

He came from this town
We used to pretend we were married and start again
He read the Bible
Showed me what Jesus said
He said I should rewrite (He only read the red)


I want Jesus to take me out this life, baby
And I talk to Jesus
And ask him if he'll think of saving me

I go back to Alabama
Take a look at my life
Nothing looks familiar here
No one even that I like
I go back to Alabama
Take a look at my life
I was so much happier when I was gonna be your wife


We had a deal and
I fucked it up when
I made the decision to become someone
We had the one thing that no one ever had
True love
It's true love


I ask Jesus to take me out this life baby
And I talk to Jesus
And ask him if he'll think of saving me

Ooh, ooh

I never meant to hurt you baby
It's so hard to be true
In this world where everything's so black and blue
I never meant to hurt you darling
It's so hard to be good
In this world where you do what you know you shouldn’t


I want Jesus to take me out this life baby
And I talk to Jesus
And ask him if he'll think of saving me

Lana Del Ray,What Happened When I Left You,"Perfect petals punctuate the fabrics yellow blue
silver platters with strawberries strewn across the room


In Zimmerman with sandals on one summer dress to choose


Three girls
eyes rolled
loud laughter
dust specs lit by afternoon


My life is sweet like lemonade now there's no bitter fruit
eternal sunshine of the spotless mind
no thought of you


My thoughts have changed
my voice is higher
now I'm over you


No flickering in my head movies
projected in Bellevue
See Lana Del Rey LiveGet tickets as low as $160
Because I captured the mood of my wish fulfilled
and sailed to Xanadu


The grief that came in waves that rolled I navigated through


The fire from my wish as wind to future trip to Malibu


now everything I have is perfect
nothing much to do


just perfect florals
green embroidered chairs
one dress to choose"
Lana Del Ray,Mermaid Motel,"Maybe we could go to Coney Island
Maybe I could sing the national anthem
Buy a white sweater for the last white day of the summer
Buy my purple wig for my mermaid video
Walk back to where I live in my motel on Neptune (Avenue) Avenue


You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say, ""Take it off, take it off""
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine
You say, ""Take it off, take it off""


(Maybe we could go to) Suede, Tokyo
Or see Van Halen at their reunion show
Heavy metal hour on TV

And you salute me, Miss America

Lana Del Ray,Backfire,"34 ContributorsBackfire Lyrics
Salvatore, you can def be my baby blue
Be my mafiosi rock 'n' roll high
Back to Malibu in our trailer park for two
We're like Sid and Nancy loving the fight


We got a jumper
Got a jumper
Got a jumper
Got a jumper
My man's crazy and his mind isn't right
But I like him, fact, I love him
I can't get e-enough of him
He knows only I can save him tonight


I've been waiting on your love
Baby, for too long now, too long now
I thought that I could change you like the others
But I don't know how, don't know how
It's gonna backfire

For a little piece of heaven
I am ready, I am willing to drown

We're always taking trips downtown
Officer Brown's always coming around
Tapping on our windows, ""Kids, come out
Ain't no way to live, let me show you how""
But we know we're not gonna change
Keep hustlin' every night and day

They all know my name now
It's just another lonely day on the playground
Okay, let's go, 1, 2, 3, 4


No I'm not vintage, no I don't care
No I'm not Kylie, no, you can't compare me to another one
There's no one else, I'm nobody, I'm just myself
It's not Fight Club, I'm a rare snowflake
But if I hear you bringing me down, calling me so fake
I will fight you (yes), I will fight you (yes)
Because in the end, there's only truth and God is gonna smite you
Besides that, I don't like you


I just wanna party boy, I don't wanna fight
But everybody knows that that's the way it is
Only players can survive


They all know my name now

Come again another day in the game now

Biding my lines

Touring up and tearing the town, a soul sinner, yes
Sometimes I rap too
I'm a white girl, but the world is my oyster
I'm a little pearl, yep

They illuminate my face and
Leave me the dark

I guess it’s symptomatic of a slight infatuation

Met my local rock star now I’m havin' visions

You got your eyeliner, long hair, walkin’ around like you don’t care
You got me in the back of your car like a star
Is it wrong?

If it’s wrong, I don’t wanna be right

I need it, have to have it, t-take over, domination
