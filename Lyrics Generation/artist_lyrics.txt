Dragging out the dead
Singing "I miss you"
Snakes and ladders
Flip the lid
Out pops the cracker
Smacks you in the head
Knifes you in the neck
Kicks you in the teeth
Steel toe caps
Takes all your credit cards
Get up, get the gunge
Get the eggs
Get the flan in the face
The flan in the face
The flan in the face
Dance, you fucker, dance, you fucker
Don't you dare, don't you dare
Don't you, flan in the face
Take it with the love it's given
Take it with a pinch of salt
Take it to the taxman
Let me back, let me back

At the face you don't recognize

Once again, I'm in trouble with my only friend

Your royal highnesses

He's bitter and twisted
He knows what he wants
He wants to be loved and
He wants to belong
He wants us to listen
He wants us to weep
And he was a stupid baby who turned into a powerful freak


But how do you?

He lives with his mother
But we show him respect
He's a dangerous bigot
But we always forget
And he's just like his daddy
'Cause he cheats on his friends
And he steals and he bullies
Anyway that he can

Burst out of the sand

Taste the air with you
Undo all the ties
Wish that I could flip
One of those lies
Lift this all away
See that stretchy smile go
Right across your face

Here it comes
Here it comes
I can feel the hills exploding
Exploding gracefully, burning up the freeway
Here it comes


Grass is green at the edge of the bubble
Beautiful kids into beautiful trouble
They all seem to fall out of the sky and come down on you
Oh baby, burn


Fast Toyota, burns rubber
Useless rockers from England
Good times had by all
Just swallow your guilt and your conscience


Blue and white birds stepping hard on the pedal
Interstate Five runs straight down the middle
And it seems to fall out of the sky and come down on you
Oh baby, burnYou might also like

And these fruits, they still taste of poison

What do you want from me, now you got me?
Now my fingers bleed, now they stare at me

And I twist and turn in a Chinese burn
You won't let go

What do you want from me, now you got me?
Now my energy, you suck from me

Bummed out again by your only business friend
The smell of fear is thicker than you think
Don't do it, don't jump
Changed shape to fit, in the end, you just feel sick
A million love songs under anaesthetic
Hey, don’t do it, don't jump


Lewis, save yourself the pain
You'll never get there
Lewis, save yourself the pain
It never really mattered


We never noticed, we never understood
He'd just get crushed to fit, he never even smelled out the best
It's the best, it’s the best day of your life

And if it's alright, this place is gassed by fear
And if it's alright, I'll tell you, 'cause you never understand
And if it's alright, I'll beg you, 'cause I'm a begging kind of man

Packed a bag and took a jet

Twitching and salivating like with myxomatosis

5 ContributorsThe Jumbled Words of Climbing up the Walls Read by Little Dan Clements LyricsI am the key to locking your dress
That keeps your toys in the basement
And if you get too far inside
You'll find you came out where you went in
So tuck the kids in safe tonight
And shut the eyes in the cupboard
I am the weapon that you needed
Keep an eye out for the neighbours
Anyway you turn
I'll be there
Open your skull
I'll be there
Climbing up the walls
I am the club and carving knife
We are friends til we die
You should not walk alone at night
You must show me your care
In the time when the lights go out
I am her face when she sleeps
I can't remember how it happened
Fifteen blows to the brain
I am the face on the news
I will strike when the- I will strike anytime
I will knock fifteen times
I have the smell of a local man
I can strike anytime
I am the pick in the ice in the quiet country lanes
I am the newspaper round
I am the eyes in the cupboard
I am the creak in the floorboards
I am the crack of the hammer
Overhead powerlines
I am the old, frightened
I am the years, ever... poording

5 ContributorsBig Bird Story by Stanley Donwood Lyrics
Big Bird
Whilst on a walking holiday in remote regions
I chance upon a secluded valley
Away from the popular walking routes
Some distance along the valley
I come across a scene so breathtakingly beautiful
That I drop to my knees in wonder

There  is something about the serried ranks
Of deciduous and coniferous trees
Standing tall on the opposite bank
Of the river that sets my heart ablaze

The colours of the foliage are poetic
Whilst the arrangement of species seems divinely inspired
Clouds swoop and whirl above the topmost branches
And the river sparkles through an uncertain reflection below
Suddenly, the sky darkens, and along the river advances a flotilla of huge birds with menacing eyes

The size of the birds staggers me; one is as tall as a bus, and the others not much smaller
Their plumage is a shimmering blue
But their eyes are full of hate and looming disaster
With a horrible sinking feeling
I realise that the birds have noticed me
You might also likeOne of them clambers up the nearside bank
And waddles towards me
I take to my heels, and scramble along the path
Gaining speed, I run at full tilt
Then I see people in front of me, running towards me

First one passes, then another, then another
They are wide-eyed with terror, and keep taking quick
Fearful looks behind them
There must, I realise, be something unutterably horrible in front of me, but my fear of the big birds compels me to carry on

More people run past me, all with the same frightened expression. They are running towards the birds, away from something unknown
I am running from the birds, towards something unknown. Not for the first time in my life, I curse my bad luckEmbed

Open up your skull

I am the weapon that you needed

I may as well be dead
I know what I want, baby
I know what I want, baby
I know what I want and it is
It's written in your head and
If we stand up they'll
Mow us down again


The unacceptable face of

The smiling brotherhood
The joy of the uprising
The action into the chain
An action with some meaning
A brief release of hope

She ate me up for breakfast
She screwed me in a vice
But now

Feel so tongue-tied


I sat in the cupboard
And wrote it down in neat
They were cheering and waving, cheering and waving
Twitching and salivating like with myxomatosis
But it got edited, fucked up
Strangled, beaten up
Used in a photo in Time magazine
Buried in a burning black hole in Devon

Everyone
Everyone around here
Everyone is so near
It's holding on
It's holding on


And everyone
Everyone is so near
Everyone has got the fear
It's holding on
It's holding on


It's holding on
It's holding on
It's holding on

5 Contributors​you’re the one LyricsLast night I tried to hold you
Swing your body all around you 
You're the one
You’re the one

Don't look, it's not so clever

You’re the one
You're the one

I'd like to sleep with you one day
Shoot you up, suck you dry

You're the one
You're the one
You're the one

I don't like to talk
To you in real life

Not this, side of the grave

You're the one
You’re the one

Blood all over the bathroom
You and I have something in common
You might also likeYou’re the one
You're the one
You’re the one

At least I didn't
Really cut in
Too much of a coward

You're the one
You're the one

At least I didn’t
Really cut in
Too much of a coward

You're the one
You're the one

The door in 
Back  survivor
And  nothing in particular
You are the one
You are the one, you are the one

You are the one
You are the one
You are the one

You are the one

You are the oneEmbed
