[Intro] 
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
[Verse 1]
 You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
[Verse 2]
 You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
You're so fucking special
[Chorus]
 But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
[Verse 3]
 I don't care if it hurts
I want to have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
[Verse 4]
 I want you to notice
When I'm not around
You're so fucking special
I wish I was special
[Chorus]
 But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
[Bridge] 
She's running out the door
She's running out
She run, run, run, run
Run
[Outro] 
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special
But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
I don't belong here
